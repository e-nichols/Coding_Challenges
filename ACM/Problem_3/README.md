#Problem 3: Fibonacci Sequence

###Problem Source:
(http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-nth-fibonacci-number/)

###Problem Overview
Write a program to output the N numbers of the Fibonacci sequence:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 141, ……..

###Language
Java

###Approach
- This is a "get your feet wet" recursion Problem
- Sequence can be define as F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)


###Outline
1. Get number of terms from user
2. Run the recursion relation
3. Output digits to user

###Takeaways
- Kept getting runtime error because I initially started my for loop at 0 as opposed to 1... smooth
- Recursion is a different way of thinking, but definitely a more efficient option than iterative approach!
